1 -- bot will send user motivational phrases at 9 AM and at 6 PM. And also
     two facts or definitions, which user wanna memorize at 1PM. 
     
     My plan is to get difference between server time and user time, so then
     each 20 minutes I will get all users, calculate time of each user and
     if time is around one of those three points - send two facts or moti-
     vating phrases.

     If user don't have any phrase he gets message, that he has no phrases.


2 -- save new user to database (
     instead of using one "get" request to check if user already exists and
     if no adding him in second "post" request, 
     try to use one request and handle db error if user already exists.
     GOOGLE HOW TO HANDLE ERRORS PROPERLY);

3 -- user can add phrases and facts, also he can check out lists of his 
     phrases and facts. If some of users phrases became useless, user can 
     use Phrase ID and remove it.
