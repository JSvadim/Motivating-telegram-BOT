!!might be I should use user timezone?

It seems I will need to save information about sending phrase to user.
Because if I check user times for instance once in 20 minutes, I should
set condition: 
serverTime - timeDifference > 530 && serverTime - timeDifference <= 550.

But if I have lots of users and one user has time difference 0 and server
executes time check at 530 mins on server? In this case next check will be
at 550 mins, that scares, since user can be left without morning message.

If same time I change a condition and expand time range from 531 - 550 
to 531 - 560, user can catch double message if time check will be at 
532 mins(userTime) and next at(552).


difference = userTime - serverTime;
if negative - server time is bigger;

sever time is 530 
I will call time check every 20 minutes

1) user difference is 20min
2) user difference is -25min
3) user difference is 119min
4) user difference is -106min


1) 530 - 20 = 510
2) 530 - (-25) = 555
3) 530 - 119 = 411
4) 530 - 106 = 424



/* 
    user times: 
    morning: 540,
    afternoon: 1020,
    evening: 1260, 
*/
